# 🧠 Fair Pay Oracle – Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts salary based on years of experience using regression techniques in Python. It follows a full machine learning pipeline — from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and cloud deployment with Azure.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build a machine learning model to estimate salary from experience.
- Explore and compare multiple regression models.
- Deploy the best model to Azure for real-time prediction via API.
- Demonstrate end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.
